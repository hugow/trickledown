--------------- done -------------------

X minimal fee for living (like: you must spend 5000 on goods at each cycle and after that your preferences apply. If you can't spend that much, you are dead.)

X player stats:
    X return on investment for each industrial sector

X player ranking by spending on goods (NOT by total cash -> more active industry)

X player charts:
    X (pie) revenue sources: goods, investments, savings, education, taxes
    X (pie) spending: salary, dividends, tax return

X dynamic charts (preferably in canvas)
    X more 'slim'
    X line , pie, bar, 'trail'
    (this was solved by jqPlot)

X world charts:
    X (pie) the market shares of each industrial sector
    X (pie) for each industrial sector, its revenues (invest, gov, purchase)
    X (pie) spending per capita: goods, investments, savings, education, taxes
